        <p>I took a big leap of faith and decided to change my career.  I was to quit my city job, to sales and make a bunch of money in a short time.  With that money I planned to live off of while working a menial part time job just to keep the money rolling in.  I would have self studied and/or joined a bootcamp and enter the tech space.  Once in the tech space I would have finished school pursuing a degree in Computer Science, which I'm 4 classes away from achieving an Associates.  From their I would delve deeper into my true reason, Artificial Intelligence.<br>

        <p>Currently I'm doing gig app work, which does not pay much, but I am studying Web Dev and hoping to parlay these skills along with my prior experience as my way into the tech space.  I feel that I am ready to take on t he industry now.  I began thinking that since I have over 10 years of Real Estate experience I could get a foot in the door of a tech company through their sales department.  I'm currently revamping my resume, wish me luck.  Sidebar: I don't think I need <strong>luck</strong>, but it sounds cool to say, <em>wish me luck</em>.</p>
